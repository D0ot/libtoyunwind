# What is indented to be done?

1. local stack unwind and remote stack unwind, local stack unwind first
2. x86_64 and aarch64, x86_64 first, linux platform only.
3. api interface: hpux unwind api


# Major Steps
1. [x] study local hpux unwind api
    a. [x] how to use local hpux unwind api ?

2. [] study dwarf and dwarf CFI (maybe ELF format is needed)
    a. [] study CFI directives, how to parse it with hexdump and human eyes...
    b. [] write a simple lib to parse it

3. [] implement local stack unwind on x86_64
    a. [] some arch dependent things, maybe things like "getcontext()"

4. [] study remote hpux unwind api
    a. [] how to use remote hunx uninwd api ?

5. [] implement remote stack unwind on x86_64
    a. [] refactor could be needed to reuse the local unwind code

6. [] things abot aarch64


# Designs

1. make dwarf CFI related code platform and arch independent
